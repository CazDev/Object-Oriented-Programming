# Improvements
 *  Changed magic numbers "720" in Stage.java to Main.getScreenHeight() on lines 56, 63, 65 and 73.
	*  Also made Screen Dimensions easier to access by creating get functions in Main.java class lines 10 to 18 this adjustment was made so that above point is possible.
 
 *  Changed the window Dimension Width to 1000 to show all information on the right without going off screen in Main.java, line 10.
	* This was a quick and easy fix for better readability.
 
 *  Changed SelectingTarget and SelectingNewLocation to cell outlines of different colours to differentiate between the two states.
	* Changes in Stage.java lines 49 to 55 and in Grid.java lines 97 to 100.
