# State Pattern explaination
  * State design pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state.
  * Therefore I will be using the state pattern because the game is based on states as shown in the top right corner.

#Benefits of using the State Pattern
  * polymorphic behavior
  * Easier to add states to support additional behavior.
  * An objectâ€™s behavior is the result of the function of its state. (This is reflected in the game)
  * The State design pattern also improves Cohesion since state-specific behaviors are aggregated into the State classes, which are placed in one location in the code.
