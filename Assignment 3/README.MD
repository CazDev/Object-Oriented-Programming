<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
<p>The starting point for assignment three has a couple of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole game freezes whenever the Mole decides to move.</li>
<li>There seems to be a problem with the pathfinding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your job is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix these problems</li>
<li>describe your solution to each problem</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that is done, you are asked to check if your solution works as the game scales.&nbsp; A solution&nbsp;<em>works as the game scales</em> if the game remains responsive as the grid size grows and character locations move further apart, no character may have to wait for another to finish calculating their path before calculating theirs.&nbsp; If not, you must come up with a new solution that does.&nbsp; Your solution should not rely on faster path-finding - it must be purely based on safe multi-threading.</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; Fixing the problem is very easy if you know where to look, thus we have allocated a significant proportion of the marks to your <em>explanations</em>.&nbsp; Note also that you will need very clear and correct explanations for full marks.</p>
<h3>Marking</h3>
<ul>
<li>(30 marks) <code>BUGS.md</code> which contains your explanations of<em> what causes</em> the mole bug (10 marks) and the pathfinding bug (20 marks)<em><br></em></li>
<li>(10 marks) A fix for the mole bug</li>
<li>(25 marks) A fix for the pathfinding bug<em></em></li>
<li>(5 marks) <code>SOLUTION_ONE.md</code> which contains a description of your solution to the mole bug</li>
<li>(30 marks) <code>SOLUTION_TWO.md</code> which contains a description of your&nbsp; solution to the pathfinding bug - the solution that will scale.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>You must submit a zipped VSCode project. Your maker will download your zip file, open it in VSCode and run it from there. Please don't submit unnecessary temporary files (such as class files) in your zip file.</p>
<p>A VSCode project that contains solutions to the mole bug (15 marks) and the pathfinding bug (30 marks).</p>
